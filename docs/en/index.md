## What is EMD?

EMD (Easy Model Deployer) is a lightweight tool for deploying AI models to production environments. It simplifies the process of deploying large language models (LLMs), vision models, embedding models, and more to AWS services or locally.

With EMD, you can:

- Deploy models to SageMaker, ECS, EC2, or locally with minimal commands
- Skip complex infrastructure setup and container configuration
- Access models through an OpenAI-compatible API
- Integrate with popular frameworks and tools
- Optimize costs by choosing the right infrastructure

EMD handles the technical complexity so you can focus on building applications with your models.

## Supported Models

EMD supports a wide range of models, including:

- Large Language Models (LLMs) like Qwen, Llama, DeepSeek, and more
- Vision Language Models (VLMs) like Qwen-VL
- Embedding models like BGE and Jina
- Reranking models
- Audio transcription models

For a complete list, see [Supported Models](supported_models.md).

## Use Cases

- **AI Application Development**: Build AI-powered applications with your own deployed models
- **Cost-Effective Inference**: Deploy models on the right infrastructure for your needs
- **Private Model Hosting**: Keep your models and data secure on your own infrastructure
- **Integration with Existing Tools**: Connect with popular frameworks and platforms
- **Hybrid Deployments**: Combine cloud and local deployments for optimal performance
